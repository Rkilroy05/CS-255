Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The proprietor of DriverPass intends to develop a website aimed at enhancing driver training. Concerned with the prevalence of inadequate driver education leading to a high rate of failure, the proprietor seeks to address this issue. The client, who owns DriverPass, has tasked us with creating a system for student drivers to enroll in driving courses. Our objective is to establish a platform allowing users to register, select from various driving packages, access online training resources, undertake examinations, and participate in practical on-road training. The proprietor expects to have full access to all student and employee accounts.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt quite confident about my work concerning the business requirements for project one.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
IN all honestly i would revise my diagrams to I would make them more indepth and more interesting 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When developing the system design, the consideration of user needs has been paramount. This approach involved the creation of diagrams that accurately represented the anticipated user interactions. In the construction of the class diagram, the sequence and activity diagrams were pivotal in projecting the individual class utilization. Failing to scrutinize user needs during the design process may result in a system design that is too theoretical to effectively address the intended issues.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In the process of software design, the initial step involves acquiring the requirements for the new system functionalities. Subsequently, the system is designed and the new features are integrated. To facilitate further analysis, soliciting feedback holds paramount importance. Upon obtaining the feedback, it is imperative to deliberate on the constraints of the system. Consequently, necessary amendments or adjustments can be made to enhance the system's functionality.
